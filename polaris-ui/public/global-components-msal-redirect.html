  <title>Global components auth termination</title>

<!-- 
  This file is part of an experimental feature (see #FCT2-8790). The file exists so that silent 
  MSAL flows initiated by global components have a predictable URL to terminate at.  
  
  When the global header is present in an app, the header will initiate a silent MSAL flow to
  attempt to obtain the logged-in user's account information. It is necessary that the termination 
  point is within the same origin as the point where the flow was initiated - hence the existence 
  of this file within this folder.

  This file doesn't interfere with the operation of the host app.
